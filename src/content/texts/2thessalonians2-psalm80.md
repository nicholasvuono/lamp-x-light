#### 2 Thessalonians 2

<br/>

##### The Man of Lawlessness
__1__ Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, \
__2__ not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.\
__3__ Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,\
__4__ who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.\
__5__ Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?\
__6__ And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.\
__7__ For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.\
__8__ And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.\
__9__ The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders,\
__10__ and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.\
__11__ Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false,\
__12__ in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

##### Stand Firm

__13__ But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.\
__14__ To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.\
__15__ So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.\
__16__ Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,\
__17__ comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.

#### Psalm 80

__1__ Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.\
__2__ Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us!\
__3__ Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved!\
__4__ O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?\
__5__ You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure.\
__6__ You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.\
__7__ Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved!\
__8__ You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.\
__9__ You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.\
__10__ The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.\
__11__ It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River.\
__12__ Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?\
__13__ The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.\
__14__ Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine,\
__15__ the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.\
__16__ They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face!\
__17__ But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!\
__18__ Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name!\
__19__ Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved!
